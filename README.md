📚PROBLEM STATEMENT :
"The task is to classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width."


🌸 Iris Flower Classification
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! 
    🌿 In this project, we build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their physical attributes. With just a few simple measurements, we can predict whether an iris is a Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica!
 
The Iris dataset contains measurements of irises and aims to classify them into three species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Each flower sample has four features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Our goal is to build a model that takes these features and predicts the species of the iris flower. 🎯

🔧 Tools and Libraries Used
Python 🐍
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
Pandas for data manipulation
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
Jupyter Notebooks (Optional for interactive work)

🚀 Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository and install the required libraries:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
cd iris-flower-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt

🧠 How It Works
Load the Dataset: We load the Iris dataset which contains flower measurements and species labels.
Preprocess the Data: Standardize the feature data to ensure it is scaled properly for model training.
Train the Model: We use Logistic Regression, a powerful classification algorithm, to train our model on the dataset.
Make Predictions: The model is used to predict the species of new iris flowers based on their measurements.
Evaluate the Model: We evaluate the performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

🎯 Results
After training the model, we achieved a high accuracy in predicting the species of iris flowers, with 100% accuracy in most cases. 🎉

Here are the performance metrics:
Accuracy: 100%
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Excellent performance across all classes.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of model predictions vs actual species.
📈 Visualizations
We visualize the relationships between features using scatter plots and other techniques to gain insights into how the model is performing.
